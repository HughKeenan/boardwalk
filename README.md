The Boardwalk School of Acting
The Boardwalk School of Acting is an amateur dramatic society based in the south-east of Ireland. It offers weekly classes in acting for adults and children teaching a range of techniques, with occasional workshops in other disciplines such as directing. It offers a fun way for people to get involved in a hobby they might not have considered before, a chance to meet new people and overcome shyness and a fear of public speaking.

Users of this site will learn about what the school offers as well as class times, pricing information and the benefits of acting as a hobby. The target user for this site is anyone based in the south-east of Ireland who wishes to pursue stage acting.

Bugs encountered:
Icons for social media links initially would not display. This was resolved after re-examining the code and realising the embed kit from FontAwesome had not been added

Could not change color on social media icons. This was resolved after removing a second class tag from the HTML and putting the class name in the initial one.

Nav links were initially unresponsive and produced a 404 error. After review of information contained in the following link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-links-to-sections-within-the-same-page-in-html/ it was determined that href links had not been equipped with the # symbol to denote the destination. Once added they were responsive.

When attempting to add images, the initial attempt to add in html resulted in an image too large for the page. A second attempt to add through css did not display the whole image.
