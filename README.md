The Boardwalk School of Acting
The Boardwalk School of Acting is an amateur dramatic society based in the south-east of Ireland. It offers weekly classes in acting for adults and children teaching a range of techniques, with occasional workshops in other disciplines such as directing. It offers a fun way for people to get involved in a hobby they might not have considered before, a chance to meet new people and overcome shyness and a fear of public speaking.

Users of this site will learn about what the school offers as well as class times, pricing information and the benefits of acting as a hobby. The target user for this site is anyone based in the south-east of Ireland who wishes to pursue stage acting.
