            <h2>Quarterly Courses</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Every quarter we offer a selection of 3 different short courses in areas outside of our normal lesson
                plan.
                If you want to expand your skillset or just try something that looks like fun, consider signing up.
                The same courses won't be repeated every quarter so don't miss your chance! Please note that every
                class requires a minimum of 5 participants to go ahead, with a maximum capacity of 15, and the cost of
                the class will be split
                evenly between the number of attendees.</p>
