                        The Boardwalk School of Acting is a newly-established acting school based in Co. Carlow. We
                        offer regular lessons to adults and children ages 5 - 18 in dramatic acting and quarterly
                        courses in other aspects of theatre such as singing and dance, direction and use of sound and
                        lighting systems. Actors of all levels are welcome, no prior experience required!
                    </p>

                        both
                        stage and screen. While not a professional theatre company, in addition to our regular classes,
                        it
                        is our goal to being staging full-length productions and one act plays regularly within the next

                        Acting is a fantastic way to meet people and make new friendships for adults and children alike.
                        It offers a chance to try out something completely new and is great for building confidence and
                        helping to overcome a fear of public speaking. It helps with learning how to work in a team and
                        is great for helping to train your memory.
